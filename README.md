## Sumary
The Garvis Repair application is a mobile application which allows employees, managers, and owner of Garvis Pool Inc. to better communicate within their company. The application manages employee schedules by creating task called “work orders” that are assigned a date, time, client, and job to be completed. The application also keeps log of all the company’s clients, their addresses, and email addresses. All of this information is available to any employee through the use of a database, FireBase. FireBase allows the user to create, read, update, and delete work orders and client information stored in the database.
